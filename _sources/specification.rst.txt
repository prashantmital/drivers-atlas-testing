Abstract
--------

Testing drivers against Atlas clusters undergoing maintenance is required to increase the likelihood that deviations
of driver behavior from the high-availability and/or graceful-failure characteristics promised by `driver
specifications <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications>`_ are detected and rectified during development.
This specification outlines a testing framework that streamlines the process of testing drivers against Atlas clusters
undergoing maintenance thereby ensuring expeditious incorporation of this additional testing into all driver projects.
The improved test coverage will result in a superior user experience as workload disruption during planned maintenance
due to undiscovered bugs in the drivers, server or Atlas will become less likely.

---------------------
Architecture Overview
---------------------

To ensure maintainability and extensibility, the Atlas Planned Maintenance Testing Framework has a modular design
comprised of the following components:

#. Test Scenario Format: the test format creates a standard language for describing Atlas Planned Maintenance Tests.
#. Workload Executor: a user-implemented, driver-specific script with a standard command-line API that translates driver
   workloads described in the test scenario format into driver operations that are run against the test cluster.
#. Test Orchestrator: a command-line utility that accepts Workload Executor and test specification in the
   Test Scenario Format and runs an Atlas Planned Maintenance Test. The Atlas Controller is responsible for
   leveraging the Atlas API to provision, configure, and monitor the Atlas cluster.

   Schematic representation of the test framework architecture.


The subsequent sections describe each of these components in greater detail and are intended as a reference for implementation of the testing framework described in this specification. Drivers MUST integrate this testing framework into their continuous integration workflow - see the Integration Guide for instructions.


--------------------
Test Scenario Format
--------------------

The test scenario format is used for defining platform-independent *Atlas Planned Maintenance Tests* in YAML-formatted
*Test Scenario Files*. Each Test Scenario File describes exactly one Atlas Planned Maintenance Test. A Test Scenario
File has the following keys:

* maintenancePlan (document): a *Planned Maintenance Scenario* object. Each object has the following keys:

  * initialConfiguration (document): Description of *Cluster Configuration Options* to be used for initializing the
    test cluster. This document MUST contain the following keys:

    * clusterConfiguration (document): Document containing initial *Basic Configuration Options* values.
      This document MUST, at a minimum, have all fields **required** by the Create One Cluster [#f2]_ endpoint.
    * processArgs (document): Document containing initial *Advanced Configuration Option* values. This MAY be an empty
      document if the maintenance plan does not require modifying the Advanced Configuration Options.

  * finalConfiguration (document): Description of **new** *Cluster Configuration Options* to be applied to the
    test cluster. This document MUST contain the following keys (note that at least one of these fields MUST be
    a non-empty document):

    * clusterConfiguration (document): Document containing final *Basic Configuration Option* values.
      This MAY be an empty document if no changes to the Basic Configuration Options are needed by the maintenance plan.
      If non-empty, this document MUST, at a minimum, have all fields **required** by the Modify One Cluster [#f3]_ endpoint.
    * processArgs (document): Document containing final *Advanced Configuration Option* values.
      This MAY be an empty document if the maintenance plan does not require modifying the Advanced Configuration Options.

  * uriOptions (document): Document containing ``key: value`` pairs of URI options that must be included in the
    connection string passed to the workload executor by the *Test Orchestrator*.

* driverWorkload (document): Object describing a *Driver Workload*. Has the following keys:

  * collection (string): Name of the collection to use for running test operations.
  * database (string): Name of the database to use for running test operations.
  * testData (array, optional): Array of documents to be inserted into the ``database.collection`` namespace before
    starting the test run. Test data insertion is performed by the *Test Orchestrator* and this field MUST be ignored
    by the *Workload Executor*.
  * operations (array): Array of Operation objects, each describing an operation to be executed. The operations are run
    sequentially and repeatedly until the maintenance completes. Each object has the following keys:

    * object (string): The entity on which to perform the operation. Can be "database" or "collection".
    * name (string): name of the operation.
    * arguments (document): the names and values of arguments to be passed to the operation.
    * result (optional, multiple types): The result of executing the operation. This will correspond to the operation's
      return value.


.. _workload-executor-specification:

-----------------
Workload Executor
-----------------

The *Workload Executor* is a script that must be implemented by each driver to facilitate incorporation of
*Atlas Planned Maintenance Tests* into the CI workflow of that driver. The script provides a layer of abstraction
between the *Test Orchestrator* and the code responsible for translating the *Driver Workload* (specified in the
Test Scenario Format) into actual driver operations.

User-Facing API
---------------

The workload executor MUST be an executable that can be invoked as::

  $ path/to/workload-executor connection-string workload-spec

where:

* ``path/to/workload-executor`` is the path to the Workload Executor executable script,
* ``connection-string`` is the connection string (including username, password and authentication database)
  that is to be used by the driver connect to the Atlas cluster, and
* ``workload-spec`` is a JSON blob containing the *Driver Workload* in the Test Scenario Format.


Pseudocode Implementation
-------------------------
The pseudocode implementation in this section is provided for illustrative purposes only. The actual implementation
of workload executors is dependent upon the implementation details of the Test Orchestrator and is described in the
Integration Guide.::

    # targetDriver is the driver to be tested.
    import { MongoClient } from "targetDriver"

    # The workloadRunner function accepts a connection string and a stringified JSON blob describing the driver workload.
    # This function will be invoked with arguments parsed from the command-line invocation of the workload executor script.
    function workloadRunner(connectionString: string, workloadSpec: object): void {

        # Use the MongoClient of the driver to be tested to connect to the Atlas Cluster.
        const client = MongoClient(connectionString);

        # Create objects which will be used to run operations.
        const db = client.db(workloadSpec.database_name);
        const collection = db.collection(workloadSpec.collection_name);

        # Initialize error counter.
        var error_count = 0;

        # Run the workload.
        try {
            while (True) {
                for (let operation in workloadSpec.operations) {

                    # For this example, in the event of an error, runOperation returns false.
                    # Tracebacks are caught and logged to STDOUT as is any non-error related output from the driver.
                    if (!runOperation(db, collection, operation)) {

                        # Keep track of the number of errors.
                        error_count += 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        # The workloadExecutor MUST handle SIGINT gracefully.
        # SIGINT will be used by the Test Orchestrator to terminate operations running ad infinitum.
        } catch (SIGINT) {
            # The workload statistics must be logged to STDERR.
            process.error(JSON.stringify({‘numErrors’: error_count}));

            # The workload executor MUST set a non-zero exit-code if there was a failure.
            if (error_count) { process.exit(1); }
            else { process.exit(0); }
        }
    }


-----------------
Test Orchestrator
-----------------

The Test Orchestrator is a command-line utility that ingests a Atlas Planned Maintenance Test specified in the
Test Scenario Format and leverages the Atlas API and a user-supplied Workload Executor to run the test on a live
Atlas Cluster.

Features
--------

The Test Orchestrator MUST support the following, low-level operations via the MongoDB Atlas API:

#. Creating a new Atlas Cluster with the given Cluster Configuration Options [#f2]_.
#. Adding a given IP address to the IP whitelist of an Atlas Project [#f6]_.
#. Creating a new database user with the given name and password on an Atlas Cluster [#f7]_.
#. Modifying the Cluster Configuration Options of a given, already running Atlas Cluster [#f3]_, [#f4]_.
#. Retrieving the server logs from all hosts in an Atlas Cluster [#f8]_.
#. Retrieving the Cluster State of a given Atlas Cluster.

To prevent leaking MongoDB Atlas API credentials from the test machines, the Test Orchestrator MUST support
the specification of API credentials via environment variables.

User-Facing API
---------------

The Test Orchestrator MUST be an executable that supports the following invocation pattern::

	./test-orchestrator spec-tests run-one path/to/workload-spec.yaml -e path/to/workload-executor

where:

* ``test-orchestrator`` is the Test Orchestrator executable,
* ``spec-tests run-one`` is the name of the command issued to this executable,
* ``path/to/workload-spec.yaml`` is the path to a test scenario file,
* ``-e`` is a flag indicating that the following argument is the workload executor binary, and
* ``path/to/workload-executor`` is the path to the workload executor binary that is to be used to run the Driver Workload.

Pseudocode Implementation
-------------------------

The pseudocode implementation in this section is provided for illustrative purposes only. For the sake of simplicity,
all interaction with the Atlas API in this sample implementation is handled by the ``AtlasController`` class which
implements the following interface::

    interface AtlasController {
        # Creates a new Atlas cluster from the "initial" Cluster Configuration Options of the given maintenanceScenario.
        # Returns the cluster's connection string.
        public createNewCluster(maintenanceScenario: object): string;

        # Initiates application of the "final" Cluster Configuration Options of the given maintenanceScenario.
        public triggerMaintenance(maintenanceScenario: object): void;

        # Blocks until the Cluster State becomes IDLE. Implementations MUST poll the API to monitor the Cluster State.
        # Implementations MUST account for rate limits on Atlas API resources and retry requests that fail
        # with a "429 Too Many Requests" response code.
        public waitUntilClusterIdle(): void;

        # Fetches the server (mongod & mongos) logs from the Atlas Cluster nodes and writes them to disk.
        public writeServerLogs(): void;
    }

Then, the Test Orchestrator can be implemented as follows::

    # Import the atlas controller.
    import { AtlasAPI } from "atlasController"

    # The testOrchestrator function accepts the path to a scenario YAML file
    # and the path to the workload executor executable. This function will be invoked with arguments
    # parsed from the command-line invocation of the test orchestrator binary.
    function testOrchestrator(scenarioFile: string, workloadExecutorPath: string): void {

        # Initialize Atlas controller.
        const atlasController = AtlasController();

        # Parse the maintenance scenario and the driver workload from the file.
        maintenanceScenario, driverWorkload = parseScenario(scenarioFile);

        # Create a cluster and wait for it to be ready for running operations.
        connectionString = atlasController.createNewCluster(maintenanceScenario);
        atlasController.waitUntilClusterIdle();

        # Initiate the driver workload in a subprocess.
        workloadSubprocess = spawnProcess([workloadExecutorPath, connectionString, driverWorkload]);

        # Implement maintenance plan and wait for completion.
        atlasController.triggerMaintenance(maintenanceScenario);
        atlasController.waitUntilClusterIdle();

        # Send a SIGINT to the workload executor to terminate workloads that run indefinitely.
        workloadSubprocess.send(SIGINT);

        # Write the contents of the workload executor's standard streams (stdout and stderr) to file for debugging use.
        writeWorkloadExecutorLogs(workloadSubprocess)

        # Fetch Atlas logs and write them to disk.
        atlasController.writeServerLogs();

        # The test orchestrator SHOULD output one test result file per scenario file in the standard
        # XUnit XML Format. This will enable the elegant test status console on Evergreen.
        # The XUnit output MAY use the workload statistics returned by the executor to make this output more informative.
        writeJUnitEntry(workloadSubprocess);

        # The test orchestrator sets the same exit-code as the workload executor to indicate test success/failure.
        process.exit(workloadSubprocess.exitCode);
    }

The ``astrolabe`` distribution serves as the reference implementation of the Test Orchestrator described by this
specification. Please see PyMongo's integration for an example of a Workload Executor implementation.
